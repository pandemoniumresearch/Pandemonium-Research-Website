summary: "Current LLM interfaces accumulate all context in a single unbounded window, causing unrelated threads to corrupt each other. We introduce the Conversation Tree Architecture (CTA), a hierarchical framework that organizes conversations as trees of context-isolated nodes with structured mechanisms for selective context flow."

## The Problem: Logical Context Poisoning

Large language models are increasingly used for extended, multi-topic work. But the standard interface, a flat append-only message list, handles this poorly. Every turn you've ever had, on every topic, accumulates in a single context window. Earlier threads that are no longer relevant keep influencing responses regardless.

We call this **logical context poisoning**: the progressive corruption of conversational coherence caused not by model error, but by structural mismanagement of context. It has empirical backing. Liu et al. demonstrate a "lost in the middle" effect where performance degrades when relevant information is buried in a long context. Hsieh et al. show this degradation holds even under perfect retrieval, meaning context volume itself is the problem.

Current workarounds (starting a new chat, manual summarization, system prompt re-anchoring) all treat symptoms rather than structure.

## The Architecture

The **Conversation Tree Architecture (CTA)** organizes conversations as a directed, rooted tree:

- Each **node** corresponds to a focused topic or task, maintaining its own independent context window
- The model operating within a node sees *only that node's context* at inference time
- Information moves between nodes only through explicitly defined **flow operations**

This means topically distinct threads genuinely cannot contaminate each other, not by suppression, but by structural isolation.

### Downstream Context Passing

When a child node is created from a parent, a **downstream selection function** initializes the child's context. The open design questions here are substantive: which units from the parent are actually relevant to the child? Should they be passed verbatim, as summaries, or as compressions? How much is too much?

### Upstream Context Merging

When a child node is deleted, its content can be **merged back upstream** into the parent. This is where the architecture gets interesting. The key unresolved question (which we believe is novel in this space) is *insertion positioning*: should merged content be appended to the end of the parent's context, or inserted chronologically at the point where the branch was created? We conjecture chronological insertion outperforms end-append on tasks requiring causal coherence, but this is empirically open.

A further refinement is **chunked and staggered insertion**: rather than injecting all merged content atomically, insights from the branch could be interleaved incrementally into the parent's ongoing stream. Whether this preserves coherence better than bulk insertion is an open question.

### Volatile Nodes

A **volatile node** is a branch annotated at creation with a volatile flag. It exists for the duration of a session only. On deletion, its content must either be merged upstream or purged entirely; the user decides explicitly. This is designed for exploratory threads: debugging tangents, alternative framings, hypotheses you want to investigate without committing to preserving.

```
create -> interact -> delete -> { merge | purge }
```

Volatile nodes have no analog in prior work on LLM memory management. They create a principled merge-or-purge checkpoint that mirrors how actual exploratory thinking works.

## Relation to Prior Work

The closest architectural antecedent is **MemGPT**, which proposes virtual context management inspired by OS memory hierarchies. But MemGPT manages memory *within* a single linear conversation and doesn't restructure the conversation itself. Its flow decisions are also made autonomously, whereas the CTA treats branching as a deliberate, user-initiated act.

The most directly related concurrent work is **ContextBranch**, which applies version control semantics to LLM conversations and demonstrates empirically that branching reduces context size by 58.1% with large effect sizes on focus and context awareness. The CTA and ContextBranch share the core observation that isolation prevents poisoning. They differ in scope (ContextBranch targets software engineering workflows; the CTA is a general-purpose framework), and the CTA introduces volatile nodes and the insertion-positioning problem that ContextBranch does not address.

## Prototype

A working prototype is live at [the-conversation-tree.vercel.app](https://the-conversation-tree.vercel.app), built with React and React Flow for tree visualization, backed by Groq and Gemini APIs.

The prototype implements core structural primitives: node creation and branching, full context isolation, downstream passing (full-context or clean-window), and volatile node designation with merge-or-purge on deletion. Intelligent relevance filtering, automatic condensation, and chronological insertion positioning are deferred to future work as the primary research agenda.

## Multi-Agent Extension

The node-and-flow abstraction extends naturally to multi-agent systems. Each node can be associated with a distinct specialized agent. Downstream flow becomes task delegation with selective context seeding; upstream merge becomes result aggregation with relevance filtering; cross-node passing becomes peer-to-peer inter-agent communication. The tree topology provides a principled structure for organizing agent collaboration hierarchies, something flat unstructured multi-agent frameworks don't provide natively.

## Open Problems

The primary open questions driving our next phase of work:

1. **Relevance selection for downstream passing** - can semantic similarity between the child's initial prompt and parent context units serve as a reliable signal? Can this be learned end-to-end from human feedback?
2. **Insertion positioning** - chronological vs. end-append, and whether chunked staggered insertion is better than both for maintaining causal coherence
3. **Empirical evaluation** - does the CTA reduce measurable quality degradation on multi-topic tasks? Does it improve completion rates? Does it reduce total tokens for equivalent outcomes?

The CTA is not a memory system. It is a structural reorganization of the conversation itself, one that prevents irrelevant context from accumulating in the first place rather than attempting to retrieve signal from within a noisy window.
